"""Text-Graph Synergy Verifier — bidirectional memory verification.

Two retrieval channels that check each other's work:

Graph → Text (verification):
  Graph entities vote on which text memories are relevant.
  A memory that mentions 3 entities from the graph walk scores
  higher than one that matches semantically but shares no entities.

Text → Graph (completion):
  Text memories mention entities the graph walk missed (orphans).
  These orphan entities are "bridged" back into the graph context,
  recovering reasoning paths that pruning discarded.

The result: retrieval that's both precise (graph-verified) and
complete (text-recovered).
